OpenSim-Kinect
==============

This is an application that allows navigation in the OpenSim environment via the Microsoft Kinect.

However, the application is easily portable to any other virtual environment or game. 

The project is part of an University Project run in April 2013. I am not planning to improve this project any time soon. However, feel free to contribute to it.


TODO
==============
- speech recognition
- increase the set of recognised gestures
- increase the precision of gestures' recognition

Acknowledgment 
==============
I must thanks wmarshid and gicoupar, my team mates, for their great contribution to the overall project, which included building part of the town of St. Andrews, UK, as well as virtual life for it.
