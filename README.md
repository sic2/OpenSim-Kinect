OpenSim-Kinect
==============

This is an application that allows navigation in the OpenSim environment via the Microsoft Kinect.

However, the application is easily portable to any other virtual environment or game. 

The project is part of an University Project run in April 2013. 
Acknowledgment to wmarshid and gicoupar for their contribution to the overall project, which included building part of the town of St. Andrews, UK, as well as virtual life for it.
